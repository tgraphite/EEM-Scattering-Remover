# Radius for rayleigh, second rayleigh and raman scattering removals.
ram-wavenumber      3600.0
# Raman scattering wavenumber, depends on the characteristics of solvent.
relaxation-disp     3.0
# Displacement for relaxation applied on points removed. Integer!
# When a data point is removed (set to zero), the program will try to look for four neighbouring data points ---
# [em +- (relax-disp)*(em-step), ex +- (relax-disp)*(ex-step)]
# ---- using their mean value to fill the zero, the relaxation-disp decides where to find those neighbouring points.
# The greater the relaxation-disp is, the more 'vague' the final figure will be, and vice versa.
